# There are diphtongs and long vowels, but in general, it is difficult in Jivaroan to decide on their status. Because there are not many vowels, it might be better to simply ignore this.

# notes for the transcription
#
# when there is an /i/ in the syllable before /ptkjmnv/, then these consonants get palatalized
# underscored vowels are nasalisation
# the accent is probably related to underlying stress, no sound difference
# capital letters are only for names, no sound difference
# all sequences of identical vowels seem to be long vowels
# sequences of identical vowels with the stress on the second vowel are probably not long vowels!
# diphtong /ai/ is pronounced as [ei] in non-initial syllables
